There is no need for a separate Writer class.
It's easier to make Buffer implement Downstream interface, since any buffer
must be populated at least once. If at any point we need multiple writers,
it is as simple as creating a wrapper for buffer supporting N Downstream, providing
a synchronization between them out of the box.
